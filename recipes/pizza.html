        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
    <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, vegetables, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, olive oil, salt, and sugar. Add the yeast mixture and mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C).</li>
    <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal pieces. Roll out each piece into a 12-inch circle on a floured surface.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over each pizza base.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese and add your desired toppings.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>
